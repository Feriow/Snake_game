# Project: Snake Game
This is was a practice project to create the old snake game at Digital Innovation One's WEB development bootcamp. The lessons and project were created by Gabriela Pinheiro (https://github.com/SpruceGabriela).

**I'll be upgrading the original code. So far, these are the implemented changes:**

- Using Font Awesome to have an icon by the title.
